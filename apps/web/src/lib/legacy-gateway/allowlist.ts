/**
 * The collection allowlist, in code (TD-5).
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: the Firestore bootstrap credential is a
 * **project-level reader**. GCP IAM has no per-collection read grant and the
 * Admin SDK bypasses security rules, so the credential can technically read
 * every collection in the project. TD-5 accepts that blast radius as
 * time-boxed and shadow-only *on condition* that Gu OS narrows it itself. This
 * module is that narrowing, and it is the only place a source path may be
 * named.
 *
 * The Mongo credential is read-only but was delivered with a database-level
 * grant on `bot` and `gu2` rather than a collection-level grant on
 * `appointments` (the human-accepted temporary deviation recorded in the R1
 * Slice Plan). The same reasoning applies with more force: the code allowlist
 * is what actually holds the line until that credential retires at C6.
 *
 * Adding an entry is a capability-surface decision. It belongs to a Slice, and
 * it must be traceable to a governing source - never to "the adapter needed it".
