/**
 * Provenance and freshness construction (TD-5: "provenance on every result";
 * AC-1 6.5).
 *
 * There is one builder and every capability goes through it, so a result
 * without provenance is not something a contributor can produce by forgetting -
 * they would have to construct the envelope by hand.
 *
 * On freshness: these reads are fresh operational reads by architecture. What
 * this module records is *how fresh*, taken from the source's own timestamp
 * where it has one, with the field name kept so the number is auditable. Where
 * the source carries no usable timestamp, `sourceUpdatedAt` and `ageSeconds`
 * are null rather than filled in with `readAt` - which would report every read
 * as perfectly fresh and quietly destroy the signal.
