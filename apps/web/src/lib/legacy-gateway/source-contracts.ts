/**
 * Recorded source contracts for the SL-1 first-wave capabilities (TD-5) and
 * the SL-6 conversation-authority read (TD-3 Q17).
 *
 * The SL-1 contracts below are not guesses from documentation. Every field
 * name, kind and required/optional decision on those was taken first-hand
 * from the live Traditional Gu stores on 2026-09-04, through the read
 * identities issued for that Slice, with the sample sizes recorded per
 * contract. The SL-6 contracts are **code-derived**, not a hosted sample —
 * that limitation is recorded on those contracts, not hidden.
 *
 * How `required` was decided, because it is the whole difference between a
 * useful alarm and one operators learn to ignore:
 *
 *   * a field is **required** only where the observed sample had it on
 *     **every** document AND the normalizer depends on it. Its absence then
 *     genuinely indicates the shape moved.
 *   * a field the capability uses but that is only *usually* present (the lead
 *     `Asesor` reference at 147/150, `users.organization_id` at 112/120) is
 *     **optional**. Its absence is ordinary data variance, and the capability
 *     handles it by refusing the read on containment grounds - not by paging
 *     an operator.
 *   * every declared field is kind-checked when present. A field that changes
 *     representation - a `DocumentReference` becoming a string, `conversation`
 *     becoming an object - is exactly the drift these contracts exist to catch.
