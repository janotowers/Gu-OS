# Gu OS documentation map

This index defines **which artifact owns which kind of truth** across Gu / Gu OS.

Gu OS documentation is intentionally layered. A Product PRD, a Feature / Business Spec, an ADR, a Technical Plan, code and verification evidence can all describe the same initiative without being competing sources of truth, because they answer different questions.

When two documents appear to disagree, first determine whether they are trying to own the same type of truth. If they are not, reconcile the layers rather than applying a single global precedence rule.

## Authority by question

| Question | Primary authority | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What product are we building, for whom and why? | [`product/PRD.md`](product/PRD.md) | Product intent, category, target users, product model, scope/non-goals, major journeys and success direction. |
| How is durable product responsibility organized? | [`product/PRD.md`](product/PRD.md) §7.2 Operating domains; artifacts under [`product/operating-domains/`](product/operating-domains/) | Gu OS's concrete mapping of the **optional** generic Product Area / Product Responsibility concept. Enduring business-semantic overlays, not independent runtime engines, and not a structure the Development Methodology requires of other products. Durable behavior Specs for a domain live here and outlive the increment that introduced them. |
| Where are current Gu OS Roadmap-Increment delivery / discovery / provenance artifacts filed? | [`product/roadmap-increments/`](product/roadmap-increments/) | Current Gu OS **filing convention** for per-increment Architecture Analysis, Technical Plan, Slice Plan, source audits, framing records and Slice evidence. It is a location, not an authority: an artifact's semantic type comes from its own owning contract and stated role, never from directory membership. Strategic sequencing and graduation evidence remain owned by the [Roadmap](roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md). Filed as a **sibling to** `operating-domains/`, never nested beneath one. |
| What recurring values, principles, invariants and design rules guide decisions? | [`principles/gu-os-principles-and-design-doctrine.md`](principles/gu-os-principles-and-design-doctrine.md) | Canonical Product / Architecture / AI / UX / security decision doctrine. |
| How do humans + coding agents design, build, verify, release and evolve Gu OS? | [`development/agentic-product-software-development-methodology.md`](development/agentic-product-software-development-methodology.md) | Development lifecycle, artifact ownership, human gates and evidence discipline. |
| Why should a bounded coordination effort exist now? | Initiative Brief, where one is useful | **Optional** framing artifact. An Initiative is not a Product Area / Product Responsibility, not a Roadmap Increment and not a Spec, and there is no mandatory chain through it. A Roadmap Increment normally supplies enough bounded framing on its own, so create the Spec directly; add an Initiative only when it represents a coordinated outcome the increment does not already represent. |
| What must a consequential feature / business capability do? | Approved Feature / Business Spec | Behavior truth: scope/non-goals, actors, state/decision rules, happy/unhappy paths, evidence and acceptance scenarios. Owns intended behavior regardless of whether an Initiative frames it, and may be proved across several Slices. |
| What architecture decision is binding? | Accepted ADR + relevant canonical architecture/topic source | ADRs record consequential decisions; topic sources preserve broader design context. |
| How is approved behavior intended to be realized? | Current Implementation Spec / Technical Plan | Repo-grounded implementation intent; should translate governing sources rather than silently redesign them. |
| What is the execution work? | The Slice Plan (`slice-plan.md`) — normally one per Roadmap Increment | Durable Slice contracts: ordered, bounded, independently verifiable increments with inspectable outcome, acceptance traceability, Definition of Done, Release Scope, estimate and readiness. It integrates the Slices realizing one increment; it is not created per Spec / ADR / Technical Plan, since one Slice is often governed by several of those. Implementation Tasks are derived just in time by the coding agent and are not Markdown truth. |
| What is the agent doing right now, before a PR exists? | Agent runtime / coding environment | The just-in-time Task plan and the current pre-PR implementation and local-verification context. Not recorded anywhere else, and not canonical Markdown truth. |
| What has execution actually produced and recorded? | GitHub | Branch, commits, PR, CI results, merge state, Actions runs, environment approvals and the deployment evidence GitHub itself generates. Repo documents do not mirror execution state. |
| Where is everything at a glance? | **No single current authority.** Live development state is split across the rows above: the Slice Plan holds durable contracts and readiness, the agent runtime holds pre-PR execution, GitHub holds recorded execution state. | A future Development Control Plane / Board would **project and orchestrate** across those authorities — READY Horizon, Cycle proposal and inclusion, confirmed Accountable / DRI, blockers and Needs Human Attention, dependency conflicts, increment graduation status, calibration learning and next-legitimate-action visibility — without owning any of the underlying truth. **It does not exist today**, and until it does, ask each authority directly rather than expecting one consolidated view. Conceptual only; see Development Methodology §19.1. |
| What actually runs now? | Current code, migrations/config + [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | Implemented reality. Proposed schema in a plan is not implemented behavior. |
| Is the implementation correct / ready? | Tests, evals, replay/simulation, readiness and release evidence | Verification truth; an agent saying “done” is not evidence. |
| What should happen next and in what sequence? | [`roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md`](roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md) | Strategic sequencing truth: **Roadmap Increments** (Gu OS's R-numbered horizons), what must exist before the proof is credible, evidence gates, the **graduation evidence** that closes an increment, and deliberately deferred work. A Roadmap Increment may pull work from several product responsibilities and shared/core capabilities. Roadmap behavior is not owned by Specs or Slice Plans, and completing every planned Slice does not graduate an increment. |
| What should change after outcomes / incidents? | Versioned change to the artifact that owns the defect | Follow the governed improvement loop; do not let implementation drift become new truth silently. |

## Technical authority within the same question

When **technical sources are actually competing for the same truth**, use these rules:

1. **Implemented behavior:** current migrations, code/config and [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).
2. **Accepted consequential decision:** the applicable accepted ADR, unless superseded.
3. **Integrated current/target architecture:** [`manuals/architecture-manual.md`](manuals/architecture-manual.md).
4. **Topic-specific accepted target design:** the canonical topic plan/source listed below.
5. **Implementation sequencing:** current Technical / Detailed Implementation Plan for that topic.
6. **Product sequencing:** [`roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md`](roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md).
7. **Reference analyses / external material / superseded plans:** context and provenance only.

A later implementation can invalidate an outdated Technical Plan, but it cannot silently redefine product intent, intended behavior, a still-active invariant or an accepted architecture decision. Reconcile the owning artifact explicitly.

## Supporting explanatory and reference documents

These are **not canonical**. They are listed so they can be found and correctly classified, not so they can be cited as authority. Where any of them differs from the artifact that owns the relevant truth — per *Authority by question* and *Canonical documents by topic* above — **the owning artifact wins**, and the reference material is context or provenance only (see *Status vocabulary*: Reference, Historical).

| Topic | Document | Role and precedence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Narrative explanation of the system | [`manuals/gu-os-understanding.md`](manuals/gu-os-understanding.md) | **Explanatory only.** Accessible Spanish walkthrough for understanding Gu OS. Not product-intent, architecture or runtime authority; where it differs from the PRD or a current-state source, those win |
| Dated agent-architecture analysis | [`manuals/gu-os-agent-architecture-analysis.md`](manuals/gu-os-agent-architecture-analysis.md) | **Historical / Reference.** Design-space analysis of the repository at the commit and date pinned in its header. Analytical value only; never a statement of what runs today |

## Artifact lifecycle

For consequential product work, the default chain is:

```text
Discover / Clarify
  -> Product PRD / parent intent
  -> Initiative Brief (when useful)
  -> Feature / Business Spec
  -> Architecture Analysis / ADR (when needed)
  -> Implementation Spec / Technical Plan
  -> Slice Plan (Vertical Slices)
  -> Just-in-time agent Tasks
  -> Implement
  -> Verify / Classify / Repair
  -> Review / Approve
  -> Release Safely
  -> Observe / Learn / Evolve
```

This is **not a waterfall**. Evidence can send the work back to the artifact that owns the defect. Different artifacts do not imply a human approval gate at every boundary; human review is proportional to consequence, as defined by the Development Methodology.

The chain sits inside strategic sequencing: the **Roadmap Increment** decides what should be proven next and declares the evidence that graduates it. The **Initiative Brief** step is optional — a Spec may be created directly under product and roadmap context. Neither an Initiative nor a Product Area / Product Responsibility is a required layer of the method; Gu OS's Operating Domains are its concrete application of the latter.

Humans plan at **Vertical Slice** level and hold accountability there; the coding agent derives Tasks at execution time. Selecting a Slice into an Execution Cycle schedules already-approved work — it is not an additional approval gate.

The chain is traversed **continuously**: the development system identifies the next legitimate action — execution, prerequisite work, verification, repair, READY-Horizon replenishment, a Cycle proposal, artifact refinement, increment-graduation evaluation, next-increment preparation or escalation — and stops only at a genuine human-authority boundary. See the Development Methodology's Development Continuity Loop.

## Five-plane knowledge pipeline

```text
raw evidence
  -> parsing and normalization
  -> chunks and indexes
  -> distilled knowledge
  -> artifacts, views, and actions
  -> outcomes and governed learning
```

- Original bytes remain immutable in private object storage or in their authoritative external system.
- Postgres stores metadata, permissions, provenance, indexes, operational state and distilled Brain knowledge.
- BigQuery/CRM remains authoritative for transactional business records where declared.
- Markdown is a machine-readable representation and portability format; it is not the universal source of truth.
- Skills encode how to act. Brain knowledge encodes what is known. Cases encode what is happening.

See the integrated pipeline in [`manuals/architecture-manual.md`](manuals/architecture-manual.md) and detailed Brain design in [`brain/gbrain-evaluation-and-plan.md`](brain/gbrain-evaluation-and-plan.md).

## Scope vocabulary

Do not collapse these dimensions:

- Skill `scope: business | personal | shared` describes the type of work.
- Knowledge ownership `platform | industry | organization | team | user` describes who owns and may see knowledge.
- Workflow `owner_scope` describes ownership of a workflow definition.
- `industry` and `domain_tags` are catalog metadata, not authorization.
- A tenant boundary is an isolation boundary; a role or team is not a tenant.
- Product operating domains (Property, Demand, Relationship, Transaction, Network/Ecosystem) are business-semantic overlays, not independent runtime engines.
- Shared / core capabilities — organization / tenancy / identity, Cases, Work Plane, Skills / Tools, governance / authority, memory / context, Brain — are **cross-cutting**, not operating domains. A Roadmap Increment may pull the minimum shared capability it needs without that capability becoming another domain.
- An **Initiative** is a bounded coordination frame, not an operating domain, not a Roadmap Increment and not a Spec. It is optional, and **no Gu OS work currently uses a distinct Initiative layer**. `docs/product/initiatives/` may be created again only if a genuine bounded Initiative is introduced.
- **Operating Domains and Roadmap Increments are sibling taxonomies, not a parent-child hierarchy.** Durable Relationship Operations behavior lives under [`product/operating-domains/`](product/operating-domains/); R1 delivery, discovery and provenance artifacts live under [`product/roadmap-increments/`](product/roadmap-increments/). Several current Gu OS Roadmap Increments do not map to one Operating Domain at all, and an increment may draw from several Product Areas and/or Shared/Core capabilities — so increments are not filed beneath a domain.
- **A directory name is not evidence of semantic type**, but a misleading one is worth fixing. The former `docs/product/initiatives/relationship-operations/` path is retired; this repository layout is a Gu OS choice, not a Development Methodology requirement.

## Status vocabulary

### Architecture / capability status

- **Implemented:** present in migrations/code and usable under its documented controls/flags.
- **Partial:** some runtime pieces exist, but the end-to-end capability does not.
- **Target:** accepted direction, not necessarily implemented.
- **Tentative:** proposed names or schema requiring implementation validation.
- **Open:** requires a product/domain/architecture decision.
- **Reference:** useful analysis/context; not authoritative runtime behavior.

### Document / decision status

- **Canonical:** active authority for the type of truth named in its scope.
- **Accepted:** approved decision/direction inside its stated scope.
- **Superseded:** retained only as a redirect/provenance surface; no longer active authority.
- **Historical:** useful record of how the system/product evolved; does not govern current work.

## Superseded and historical material

- [`business-brain-evolution-roadmap.md`](business-brain-evolution-roadmap.md) is superseded for product sequencing by [`roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md`](roadmap/gu-os-evolution-roadmap.md). Its historical content remains in Git history.
- `plan.md` and `brief.md` remain historical/reference context and do not override the Product PRD, current architecture or topic sources.
- External research, papers and reference analyses do not become Gu OS authority by citation alone. When adopted, the Gu OS-specific decision belongs in the Product PRD, Doctrine, Spec, ADR, canonical architecture source or Development Methodology according to the type of truth it owns.
