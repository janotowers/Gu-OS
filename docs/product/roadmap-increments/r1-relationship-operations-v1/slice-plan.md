> **Development method:** [`agentic-product-software-development-methodology.md`](../../../development/agentic-product-software-development-methodology.md) v0.3.2  
> **Artifact role:** Owns the **durable Slice contracts** for R1 and their order. It does **not** own intended behavior (the four approved Specs do), consequential architecture (the Architecture Analysis and ADR-106…110 do), approved technical realization and sequencing (the Technical Plan does), just-in-time implementation Tasks and pre-PR execution context (the agent runtime does), or recorded execution state — branch, commits, PR, CI, merge, Actions, environment approvals (GitHub does).

This is the first Gu OS initiative migrated to the Slice planning model of Methodology §10–§10.4, §12.1–§12.2, §14.2 and §19.1–§19.2. Slice contracts here were **extracted** from approved Technical Plan v1.4 §9; no scope, behavior, acceptance meaning, architecture decision or sequencing was changed in the move. Section 8 records what the migration exposed and needs human resolution.

## 1. How to read this plan

- The **Specs** own intended behavior. A Slice owns a bounded increment that proves part of it, or a required enabling capability.
- Slice contracts are written **rolling wave**: SL-0 and SL-1 as completed Slices whose contracts are preserved as written, SL-2…SL-13 as stubs carrying only enough to sequence, size and prioritize them. "Full" describes depth relative to the stubs, not finality — a Slice contract can still be refined by its readiness/elaboration pass.
- **Tasks are not written here.** They are derived by the coding agent once a Slice is Ready, Planned and Executable.
- **Readiness lives here; execution stage does not.** A Slice can be READY with nobody assigned; the Accountable / DRI is confirmed at planning time and recorded in §5.
- Nothing in this document is a live status board. See §5.
- Stage gates (**shadow** SL-0…SL-8b → **assisted** SL-9…SL-10 → **selective live** SL-11+) are business/authority gates per Methodology §12, **not** per-Slice approvals, and are not readiness conditions. They live in Technical Plan §5.

## 2. Shared baseline

Every non-trivial R1 Slice inherits the following, so individual contracts record only their delta. Extracted verbatim in substance from Technical Plan §9 legend, §6 and §8 — neither strengthened nor weakened here.

- **Baseline Definition of Done** (Technical Plan §9 legend): type-check / lint / validators green; module selftests wired into `test:selftests` and green; **flags off ⇒ inert**; correlation-coverage check (applies from SL-2); docs-sync note.
- **Cross-tenant negative suite** (Technical Plan §8): the two-orgs read-and-write fixture suite is required from SL-0 and **gates every multi-seat surface (SL-7+)**. Landed at SL-0 as `npm run test:rls` with its own CI job.
- **Security / tenancy invariants** (Technical Plan §6): membership-EXISTS RLS plus restrictive org-tenancy guards; `is_active_org_member` hardening; explicit `organizationId` on every service-role helper; Case-child tenancy **derived from the parent Case**; `authorizeOrgAction` on every server-route mutation; authorization resolved **before** any model context or ranking; opaque external ids only; gateway checks the org external binding **before every legacy read**.
- **Shadow-stage constraint** (Technical Plan §5): for SL-0…SL-8b there are **no prospect-facing effects**; supervisor decisions are logged and compared only.
- **Compatibility**: additive-only migrations; rollback for every table = flag off ⇒ rows inert audit data.
- **Evidence discipline** (Methodology §14): an agent assertion does not close a Slice; the declared Release Scope's evidence does.

Migration numbers are **never pre-reserved** — Technical Plan §3 defines symbolic units claimed in landing order at implementation time. Slice contracts therefore name the symbolic unit, never a number.

## 3. Slice index

Order, dependencies and Release Scope at a glance. Detail lives in §4; technical sequencing rationale stays in [`technical-plan.md`](technical-plan.md) §9.

| Slice | Title | Type | Depends on | Inspectable outcome (one line) | Release Scope | Readiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SL-0 | Org substrate & pilot bootstrap | enabling capability | — | Alebrixe is a real Organization in the system, and Organization-owned data is provably isolated from other tenants | RS-2 (achieved) | N/A — historical Done; see §6 |
| SL-1 | Gateway reads v1 (bootstrap) | enabling capability | SL-0 | Four bounded read capabilities exist and are fixture-verified with provenance and an Organization binding check; the real hosted path is proven in staging for an Alebrixe lead — with provenance and freshness metadata — and its thread-aware messages | RS-2 (achieved) | N/A — Done 2026-09-05; see §6 |
| SL-2 | Admission (shadow) | behavior | SL-0, SL-1 | Real inbound leads produce admission dispositions and shadow Opportunity Cases with visible policy-version attribution | RS-2 (indicated) | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-3 | Duplicate & supersession flows | behavior | SL-2 | Duplicate and superseded leads resolve to one canonical Opportunity with queryable lineage, without mutating Case rows | RS-2 (indicated) | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-4 | Supervisor loop (shadow) | behavior | SL-2 | Multi-day shadow Opportunities carry a coherent posture history and tracked commitments, reconstructable by replay | RS-2 (indicated) | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-5 | Event wake-ups (prod) `[L:C1]` | enabling capability | SL-2 | A signed forwarded legacy event wakes the right Case within the agreed SLA, and polling is retired | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-6 | Bindings + authority (advisory) `[L:C2 advisory]` | enabling capability | SL-2 | For pilot conversations the resolver's authority answer matches observed reality, log-only, with conflicts failing safe | RS-2 (indicated) | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-7 | Work Portfolio v1 (deterministic) | behavior | SL-0, SL-4 | An advisor sees a predicate-ranked attention list with WHY / WHAT / WHY-NOW, and snooze can never hide must-surface work | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-8 | Visit evidence v1 (shadow) | behavior | SL-4, SL-5 | A real appointment lifecycle produces visit facts that preserve *unknown*, do not inflate on reschedule, and retain conflict | RS-2 (indicated) | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-8b | Transaction boundary seam (shadow) | behavior | SL-3, SL-8 | A concrete offer creates a Transaction shell Case and an association edge with evidence on both timelines, leaving the Opportunity open | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-9 | Message effects (assisted) `[L:C3; C6 hard gate]` | behavior | SL-4, SL-6, **C6 live** | An approved prospect message is sent, correlated by `wamid`, and reconciled to delivered / failed / unknown — with zero unapproved sends | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-10 | Appointment effects (assisted) `[L:C7]` | behavior | SL-8, SL-9 | An approved appointment create / reschedule / cancel round-trips into the legacy stores and updates visit facts with provenance | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-11 | Authority transfer (selective live) `[L:C2 enforcing]` | behavior | SL-6, SL-9, SL-10 | Each pilot Opportunity is answered by exactly one runtime, and human takeover suppresses Gu while the Case continues | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-12 | Portfolio v2 (contextual ranking) | behavior | SL-7 (+SL-8 for richer evidence) | Ranking is model-contextual with evidence-grounded explanations, and must-surface work is never suppressed | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |
| SL-13 | Economics v1 | behavior | SL-9 | The send path emits keyed usage that rolls up to a proven identity, and late valuations land without rewriting history | TBD at elaboration | NOT READY — stub |

`[L:Cn]` = needs cross-repo contract Cn live (Technical Plan §4). Readiness is a property of the Slice (Methodology §10.2), and its only values are **READY** and **NOT READY**; **no Accountable / DRI, Execution Cycle or planning status is assigned in this document.** **Done Slices are not evaluated for readiness at all** — SL-0 and now SL-1 are completed history, and **Done is a completion concept, never a third readiness value.**

## 4. Slice contracts

### SL-0 — Org substrate & pilot bootstrap

**Historical, completed Slice.** Recorded here to preserve its place in the sequence. Its authoritative closure evidence lives, and stays, in [`technical-plan.md`](technical-plan.md) §9 ("Execution status — SL-0"); it is referenced rather than duplicated.

- **Type:** enabling capability
- **Inspectable outcome / value:** Alebrixe exists as a real Organization resolvable end-to-end from its legacy identity, pilot seats are explicit, and Organization-owned data is provably isolated from other tenants on both read and write paths — the prerequisite every multi-seat R1 surface depends on.
- **Governing behavior / traceability:** TD-1 (Organization, membership, contacts, external identity), TD-7 (Case relationships primitive), M-CASE-ORG; architecture contract **AC-3** (Organization, Membership, Tenancy & Identity); **ADR-106** (organization-native multi-seat tenancy); **ADR-109 §9** (Organization containment for Case relationships). No Spec acceptance scenario is claimed: SL-0 is an enabling substrate, not user-visible behavior.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Release Scope:** **RS-2 (hosted)** — achieved. Deterministic evidence plus hosted evidence in the `Gu-OS-Stage` environment. Production was deliberately **not** reached; that is Gate B.
- **Estimate / confidence:** *not available — predates the Slice calibration model.*
- **Material risk:** tenancy and authority boundary change (highest-consequence class in Technical Plan §6); mitigated by the cross-tenant negative suite becoming a release gate.
- **Readiness:** historically Done; not reinterpreted through current readiness machinery.

**Slice Acceptance Contract** — the four DoD clauses approved in Technical Plan v1.0 §9, all evidenced:

| ID | What must be demonstrably true | Governing source | Evidence type |
|---|---|---|---|
| SA-0.1 | Alebrixe Organization resolvable end-to-end | TD-1 bootstrap | hosted verification (`Gu-OS-Stage`) |
| SA-0.2 | Cross-tenant negative fixtures pass on **read and write** paths | TD-1 RLS matrix, Technical Plan §8 | deterministic suite + hosted verification with real user JWTs |
| SA-0.3 | `is_active_org_member` hardening asserted (fixed `search_path`, qualified references, `EXECUTE` restricted) | TD-1 invariant, §6 | deterministic suite |
| SA-0.4 | JSONB fallback still works | TD-1 bootstrap (discovery source, not key) | hosted verification |

**Definition of Done:** satisfied. See the Done record in §6.

---

### SL-1 — Gateway reads v1 (bootstrap)

**Full Slice contract** — substantially more detail than the SL-2…SL-13 stubs, and elaborated by the dedicated readiness pass of 2026-09-03. The Slice ran its course: READY, planned into **Cycle 1** with a confirmed human Accountable (§5), case-B prerequisite satisfied, Executable on 2026-09-04, and **Done on 2026-09-05** (§6). The contract below is preserved as written — it is what the Slice was held to, and the Done record is judged against it rather than the other way round. What this section remains is a **contract, not a workspace**: no Tasks, file-level plans or implementation decisions are recorded here — those are derived just in time by the coding agent and live in the agent runtime, PR and commit sequence.

- **Type:** enabling capability. SL-1 delivers a prerequisite contract that SL-2 and every later shadow Slice depend on; it is independently verifiable in its own right, and it produces no user-visible Relationship behavior on its own.
- **Inspectable outcome / value:** two distinct things become true, and the contract below proves exactly these and no more.
  - **(a) The bounded read capability surface exists and is contract-verified.** All four capabilities — lead context, recent **thread-aware** messages, appointment read, property read — return normalized results against recorded contract fixtures, each carrying **provenance**, each gated by an Organization external-binding check, with no generic CRUD tool and no reachable prospect-facing effect. When a source shape drifts away from its fixture, an operator is paged rather than the system silently returning wrong data.
  - **(b) The real hosted read path is proven — for the lead and its messages.** In staging, a **real Alebrixe lead** is read with **provenance and freshness metadata**, and its recent messages are read thread-aware.
  - **Deliberately not claimed:** the appointment and property capabilities are established and fixture-verified under (a), but the approved v1.4 DoD does **not** require them to be exercised against real hosted data, so this Slice does not claim a real appointment or a real property was operationally read. Strengthening the hosted evidence contract to cover them would be an explicit decision at the readiness/elaboration pass, not a silent addition during this migration.
  - **Freshness, precisely.** These are *fresh operational* read capabilities by architecture — that is TD-5's and AC-1's whole point, and nothing here weakens it. What the governing sources establish per result is **provenance** ("provenance on every result", TD-5); an explicit **freshness-metadata field** is required by the approved DoD specifically of the **hosted lead read**. This Slice therefore asserts freshness metadata where its source requires it, and does not invent a per-fixture freshness field for all four capabilities.
- **Governing behavior / traceability:**
  - **TD-5** — Operational gateway & fresh-read capabilities (hybrid target): the capability surface `legacy_lead_get_context`, `legacy_lead_get_recent_messages`, `appointment_get`, `property_get_details`; direct adapters sanctioned **only as shadow/bootstrap**; collection allowlist in code; org external-binding check before every read; provenance on every result; contract-fixture tests + drift alarms; no generic CRUD tool, ever.
  - **TD-1** — `organization_tool_secrets` with providers `traditional_gu_firestore` / `traditional_gu_mongo`; CURRENT `account_tool_secrets` untouched.
  - **AC-1 — Operational Access & Eventing** (Architecture Analysis §6), accepted decision: *"R1 uses bounded fresh operational capabilities…; BigQuery remains analytical."* Specifically §6.2 Option C (bounded operational gateway / domain capabilities) and §6.5 (freshness and authoritative reread).
  - **ADR-106** — Organization-native multi-seat tenancy: the binding check is what makes a read Organization-scoped rather than user-scoped.
  - **Technical Plan §6** — gateway checks org external-binding before every legacy read; bootstrap-adapter credentials scoped per TD-5 with blast radius documented.
  - **Prerequisite capability provided to:** SL-2 (admission needs lead context and messages), and thereafter every shadow Slice that reads operational reality.
  - **Enabled but NOT proved by this Slice** — recorded so the traceability is not overstated: S2 **AC-20** ("BigQuery stale but fresh conversation changed → fresh operational source governs live decisions") describes supervisor behavior that consumes these reads. SL-1 supplies the capability; the scenario is proved where that decision behavior lands, not here. No S1/S2/S3/S4 acceptance scenario is claimed as proved by SL-1.
- **Dependencies:**
  - **SL-0** — satisfied. `organization_tool_secrets` landed in `00080_organizations_core`; `packages/db/src/queries/organizations.ts` and `authorizeOrgAction` exist; the external-binding resolution SL-1's per-read check depends on was evidenced in Gate A.
  - **Alebrixe legacy read identities — dependency case B** (Methodology §10.2, v0.3.2): controlled by our team, with the concrete prerequisite contract stated below, and satisfiable before this Slice starts. Classified first-hand on 2026-09-03; re-evaluated against the corrected rule. **Satisfied 2026-09-04** — see §5.

    **Evidence for the classification, as established on 2026-09-03.** The identities did not exist at that point: Gu OS declared no `LEGACY`/`GATEWAY`/`FIRESTORE`/`MONGO` environment variable, its single deployment environment (`staging`) held a single secret (`GUOS_STAGING_SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL`), and no runbook recorded an issuance path. Issuance was nevertheless administered by this team — direct administrative access to the relevant Google Cloud and MongoDB Atlas projects, with no third party required to act. That is what made it case B rather than an external dependency.

    **Where the boundary falls.** `organization_tool_secrets` exists as a table (migration `00080`) but has **zero references anywhere in Gu OS code** — no query module, no runtime retrieval, no provider registry, no org-scoped encrypt/decrypt path. The `account-tool-secrets.ts` precedent is **user-scoped** (`user_id`), not Organization-scoped. Seeding those rows is therefore **not** a pre-execution prerequisite: doing it safely depends on code SL-1 itself builds, and making it a precondition would be circular. The prerequisite stops at the external identities and their secret material being available to the authorized setup path; everything from parsing that material to storing it belongs to SL-1.
    **Case-B prerequisite contract — durable.** What must be true before SL-1 can become Executable, none of which requires SL-1 to run:

    | Side | Requirement |
    |---|---|
    | **Firestore / GCP** | A dedicated Traditional Gu read identity, **no write authority**. Project-level Firestore read blast radius is accepted where IAM cannot narrow access to a collection (TD-5), bounded by shadow-only, time-boxed bootstrap use plus a Gu OS collection allowlist and the Organization external-binding check before every read. |
    | **Mongo** | A dedicated **read-only** identity, no write authority, least-privilege access limited to the resources the SL-1 capabilities actually require. |
    | **Gu OS** | Credentials stay Organization-scoped and server-only; encrypted at rest through the existing secret architecture; never returned on browser or user-JWT paths; and **no secret value in Git, logs, PRs, fixtures or evidence artifacts**. |
    | **Ownership** | Issued and owned by this team, with no third party in the path. |

    **Current provisioning scope — revalidate before credential issuance; not a semantic capability contract.** The physical names below reflect the 2026-09-03 source topology and are allowed to drift behind the bounded capability contract, which is what TD-5 makes durable. They are recorded so the identities can be scoped concretely, not to promote legacy physical topology into architecture.

    - *Firestore:* `leads/{lead_id}` and its `wsp_messeges` subcollection (the Gu-number document plus `asesor_<phone>` documents), `users/{uid}` for owner resolution, `properties/{id}`, and the replicated appointment record at **`deals/{deal_id}/appointments`**.
    - *Mongo:* the **`appointments`** collection only, in **`gu2`** — the guv3 runtime database. **Physical-source correction, 2026-09-04:** the pre-issuance scope placed this collection in `bot`. That was an incorrect physical-source assumption; `bot` has no `appointments` collection. The correct location was observed during execution and then **confirmed directly with the Traditional Gu team member responsible for the source**, so `gu2.appointments` is legacy-owner-confirmed information rather than an implementation inference. See [`sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md`](sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md) §4.

    **Revalidated 2026-09-03 before issuance** (sequenced item 1). Both legacy repositories had moved again; the drift was physical only — a log-severity change, an anti-upsert guard on a *write* path, and one additive query helper — with no read-topology change. Two scope corrections came out of it:

    - Firestore appointments are **not** a root collection: they live under `deals/{deal_id}/appointments`. The earlier scope said only "the replicated appointment record" without locating it, which would have produced an incomplete code allowlist.
    - `users_sellers` is **dropped**. It is used from the legacy TypeScript services layer; SL-1's Organization binding resolves through Gu OS's own `external_identity_bindings`, established at SL-0, so no SL-1 read needs it. Re-add only if elaboration proves otherwise.

    `bot` is what `MONGO_DB_NAME` resolves to, which is accurate; the pre-issuance scope then assumed the appointment collection lived there. It does not. The delivered grant reaches `appointments` because it also covers `gu2`, which is where that collection actually is — now confirmed by the Traditional Gu team. Also confirmed from source that `property_data` lives in a *different* database (`MONGO_DB_NAME_V1`), which the delivered identity does not reach — the exclusion holds at the credential perimeter, not only in code.

    **Least privilege — what was deliberately excluded.** Access is not granted merely because the audit mentions a dataset:

    - *Mongo `property_data`* — excluded. Audit §18 makes Firestore `properties` the authoritative record and `property_data` "search/read optimization, not authority by itself"; an authoritative detail read must not depend on the mirror.
    - *Mongo `chats` / `messagesv2` and the waProbe per-advisor arrays* — excluded. SA-1.3's contract is `source` and `delivery_status` per item, and §15.7 establishes that delivery status is written back into the **Firestore** conversation store, whose §10.1 thread model already carries the `gu` and `asesor_*` threads.
    - *Mongo lead runtime context* (`bypass_bot`, `last_owner_interaction_wba`, assignment mirror) — excluded. Those are conversation-authority signals consumed by **SL-6**, not by an SL-1 read.
    - *BigQuery* — excluded. AC-1 keeps it analytical and out of live operational reads.

    **Why Mongo is required at all.** Only for the appointment capability, and for a source-verified reason: audit §11.3 records that appointment persistence is **not atomic** across the legacy stores — Firestore-success/Mongo-failure and Firestore-failure/Mongo-success both continue — so "a read from one store cannot automatically prove the other store is synchronized". A Firestore-only `appointment_get` would silently miss appointments that landed only in Mongo. No other SL-1 capability needs Mongo.

  - **Staging environment with pilot credentials** — Technical Plan §8 requires "a staging pass with pilot credentials before each stage gate". The Gu OS hosted-verification harness exists but is **Supabase-only**: `scripts/lib/target-env.ts` resolves a `projectRef` / `databaseUrl` / publishable-key target and `scripts/verify-hosted.ts` offers the groups `smoke | schema | security`. There is no target slot, credential form or check group for a legacy source system. Extending it for a legacy read target is therefore **verification capability created inside this Slice**, the same way SL-0 built `npm run test:rls` within its own Slice; it is recorded in the Definition of Done below rather than assumed.
  - **Not** dependent on C6: TD-5 sanctions direct bootstrap adapters for shadow stages, and C6 is a hard gate before **SL-9**, not before SL-1.
- **Release Scope:** **RS-2 (hosted).** Grounded, not assumed: the approved DoD requires a "staging read of real Alebrixe lead with provenance + freshness metadata", which is environment evidence a disposable CI environment cannot establish (Methodology §11.5, §14.2). RS-1 would silently lower an existing evidence requirement. RS-3 is not implied — SL-1 is a shadow-stage Slice with no prospect-facing effect, and production rollout is the separate Gate B.
**First-hand legacy-source revalidation (2026-09-03).** Performed with the audit's own method ([`legacy-source-audit.md`](legacy-source-audit.md) §23.1): resolve current heads, confirm the audit pin is still an ancestor, diff pin→head, read every changed file relevant to the R1 question set, and classify files with no diff as STILL VALID without re-reading. Window: the audit's 2026-08-31 revalidation heads → `UnggaMX/ungga-full` `gcp/main` and `UnggaMX/ungga-landing` `main` as of 2026-09-03. Both pins remain ancestors — fast-forward history, no rewrites. Drift: **13 commits / 47 files** and **32 commits / 61 files** respectively.

| Capability | Source contract | Drift classification |
|---|---|---|
| Lead context | `lead_id = prospect_phone + bot_phone_number + owner_phone_number`, a composite operational-context key, **not** canonical Prospect or Gu OS identity (audit §5.1) | **No drift.** `ungga-full/src/guv3/gu/db/firebase/leads.py` untouched in the window → STILL VALID. |
| Thread-aware messages | `leads/{lead_id}/wsp_messeges` holds the Gu-number conversation document(s) plus one `asesor_<phone>` document per linked advisor, items carrying `source` and author; the platform flattens into typed `gu` / `advisor` threads under server-side visibility (audit §10.1) | **No drift.** `ungga-landing/src/lib/firebase/leads.ts` untouched in the window → STILL VALID. |
| Appointment | Partial persistence and Calendar-before-persistence orphan risk (audit §11) | **No drift.** No appointment source changed in the window → STILL VALID. |
| Property | Firestore is the authoritative property record; the Mongo `property_data` copy is incomplete (audit §14) | **Physical drift only.** `ungga-landing/src/lib/firebase/properties.ts` changed, but solely in the public SEO sitemap path (`listPublishedPropertiesShard`), which reaffirms Firestore as the source. `ungga-full` `MongoService.ts` now recalculates the search vector on every upsert and adds a `vector_model` field to the Mongo mirror — search infrastructure, not the property-details read contract. |

**No semantic contract change was found for any of the four capabilities.** The other material drift is the outbound WhatsApp template path (`notificator/whatsapp/whatsapp.ts`), which belongs to the send contract at **SL-9**, not to SL-1's read path, and a new public FAQ/support assistant unrelated to R1.

One shape finding worth carrying into fixtures: a property's `user_owner` has **two representations** — normally a `DocumentReference` to `users/{uid}`, but part of the imported inventory stores it as a text path — so owner resolution accepts both and returns null otherwise. This is the same normalized-versus-raw pattern SL-0 resolved for the Organization key, and it sits on the path from a property read to its Organization binding (SA-1.6).

- **Estimate:** **3–5 days** elapsed agent-assisted engineering time to evidence-ready. *(Revised from the pre-readiness initial estimate of 2–3 days; frozen at READY per Methodology §10.4 / §17.1.)*
- **Estimate confidence:** **Medium.** Estimated for the actual execution model — a coding agent working autonomously inside the approved Slice (repo inspection → JIT decomposition → implementation → fixtures/selftests → local verification → bounded repair → PR/CI iterations → evidence). Grounded in current repo state: the gateway module `apps/web/src/lib/legacy-gateway/` is net-new, but the adapter + capability pattern it extends is well precedented (52 `TOOL_CATALOG` entries; `packages/agent/src/tools/realestate-adapters.ts` with eight sibling selftests; `realestate-credentials.ts` as a credential-handling seam; `scripts/check-model-price-catalog-drift.mjs` as a drift-check precedent).

  **Why it moved from 2–3 to 3–5 days.** Two forces, and the second is larger. *Downward:* the readiness pass found **no semantic drift** in any of the four source contracts, and the lead and conversation sources are untouched since the audit — so fixture derivation, previously the dominant uncertainty, is better bounded than assumed. *Upward:* two capabilities the Slice needs turn out not to exist at all — Organization-scoped secret handling (`organization_tool_secrets` has zero code references) and a hosted verification target for a legacy source (the harness is Supabase-only). Both are net-new and both sit between SL-1 and its SA-1.2/SA-1.3 evidence.

  **What the number does and does not cover.** It covers the agent-assisted engineering path only: the org-scoped secret helper, provider parsing and validation, safe storage and the `pending_test → active` transition, the bounded legacy verification target, the four adapters and capability surface, fixtures and the drift alarm. It **excludes** issuing the two external read identities, which is pre-execution setup work performed by a human before the Slice becomes Executable — that is dependency time, not engineering elapsed, and folding it in would corrupt the calibration series.

  **Confidence stays Medium** rather than rising. Fixture risk fell and the in-Slice scope is now precisely enumerated rather than suspected, which argues upward; but this remains a net-new module built against sources that moved again on 2026-09-03, plus the `user_owner` dual representation as an extra normalization case. Medium reflects both.
- **Material risk:**
  - **Security / credential blast radius** — the Firestore bootstrap credential is whole-database read (GCP IAM has no per-collection read grant, and the Admin SDK bypasses security rules). TD-5 accepts this explicitly as time-boxed and shadow-only, compensated by a collection allowlist in code and the per-read org-binding check. This is the Slice's dominant risk and the reason its credential scopes must be documented as part of Done.
  - **Tenancy** — a read that skipped the external-binding check would be a cross-tenant read. Mitigated by the check being pre-read and by the shared-baseline cross-tenant suite.
  - **Drift** — coupling to messy physical shapes; mitigated by contract fixtures plus alarms that page an operator on mismatch.
  - **External effects:** none. Shadow stage, reads only.
  - **Flag / compatibility:** `LEGACY_GATEWAY_ENABLED` global kill-switch plus the `relationship_ops` master flag; flags off ⇒ inert per shared baseline.
  - **Rollback:** flag off; no schema change is owned by this Slice.

**Slice Acceptance Contract** — the approved SL-1 DoD from Technical Plan v1.4 §9, decomposed into assertions with evidence types. Nothing is added to or removed from the approved scope.

| SA-1.1 | Each of the four capabilities returns a normalized result against a recorded contract fixture, carrying provenance | TD-5 capability surface ("provenance on every result") | deterministic selftest |
| SA-1.2 | A **real Alebrixe lead** is read in staging, and the result carries provenance **and** freshness metadata | TD-5; Technical Plan §9 DoD; AC-1 §6.5 | hosted verification |
| SA-1.3 | Recent messages are **thread-aware** — Gu and `asesor_*` documents, with `source` and `delivery_status` per item | TD-5 (audit §10.1/§15.7) | deterministic selftest + hosted verification |
| SA-1.4 | A fixture shape mismatch **fires the drift alarm** rather than silently returning wrong data | TD-5 drift alarms | deterministic selftest (injected mismatch) |
| SA-1.5 | Credential scopes are documented, including the accepted whole-database Firestore read and its time-boxed shadow-only bound | TD-5 credentials; Technical Plan §6 | source / operational evidence |
| SA-1.6 | Every read is preceded by the Organization external-binding check; a request outside the bound Organization does not read | Technical Plan §6; ADR-106 | deterministic selftest (negative case) |
| SA-1.7 | No generic CRUD tool is introduced, and no prospect-facing effect is reachable from this Slice | TD-5; Technical Plan §5 shadow stage | deterministic assertion + review |

SA-1.6 and SA-1.7 are **slice-local assertions**: they restate invariants the governing sources already require of any gateway read, made checkable at this Slice's boundary. Coverage of unhappy paths is deliberately at contract level here (drift mismatch, out-of-binding read); scenario-level unhappy paths for admission behavior belong to SL-2.

**Definition of Done (delta over §2)**

- The four capabilities exist behind the bounded tool surface, with contract fixtures and passing selftests wired into `test:selftests`.
- **Organization-scoped secret handling is built within this Slice**, because none of it exists yet: the query/runtime helper for `organization_tool_secrets`, provider parsing and validation for `traditional_gu_firestore` / `traditional_gu_mongo`, safe storage of the prerequisite's secret material, and the `pending_test → active` transition. This is the in-Slice half of the credential boundary above.
- **Hosted verification capability for a legacy read target is created within this Slice** — the current harness targets Supabase only (`scripts/lib/target-env.ts` resolves `projectRef`/`databaseUrl`; `verify-hosted.ts` offers `smoke|schema|security`) — bounded to what SA-1.2/SA-1.3 need, with fail-closed target binding in the spirit of `target-env.ts`. **Not** a generic multi-provider verification framework; only the capability this Slice requires.
- Hosted evidence recorded from staging for SA-1.2 and SA-1.3, naming the environment reached.
- Drift alarm demonstrated firing (SA-1.4).
- Credential scopes documented (SA-1.5), including the exact scopes the case-B provisioning must grant.
- Done record states environment reached, Release Scope achieved, and what was intentionally not exercised.

**Readiness**

- **READY** — determined by the readiness/elaboration pass of 2026-09-03 and re-evaluated against **Methodology v0.3.2**.
- **Why every condition passes.** Governing behavior is approved (Technical Plan v1.5; TD-5 and AC-1 accepted) and no unresolved consequential product question sits inside this Slice's scope. The acceptance contract is stated and testable against **first-hand-revalidated** source contracts, each assertion naming a verifier type. Dependencies are classified: SL-0 satisfied, legacy read identities **case B**, and the missing hosted-verification capability is explicitly built inside the Slice rather than assumed. Release Scope RS-2 is declared and its evidence path is concrete. Security, tenancy, authority and external-effect impact are assessed, and this Slice has no external effects. The estimate is evidence-based and frozen.
- **Case B under v0.3.2, condition by condition.** The dependency is **controlled by our team** (administrative access to both providers, no third party). Its **prerequisite contract is concrete** — the table above states what must exist, at what scope and with what prohibitions, and none of it requires SL-1 to run, which is exactly the test v0.3.2 added. **Confidence is sufficient**: issuing two scoped read identities is bounded configuration work with no discovery left in it. **Cycle planning can explicitly sequence it first**, and under §18 proportionality it is named prerequisite / setup work rather than a Slice of its own — issuing two identities is not Slice-sized. Under that rule SL-1 stayed **non-Executable** until the identities existed and their secret material was available to the authorized setup path — the condition that was met on 2026-09-04 (§5).
- **What the readiness pass itself settled, and what it did not.** Readiness made the Slice eligible for Cycle planning; the pass assigned no Accountable / DRI, Execution Cycle or planning status, because those are not readiness properties (Methodology §10.2). They were settled afterwards and are recorded in §5: the Cycle 1 planning decision confirmed the Cycle and the Accountable, and completing the case-B prerequisite made the Slice Executable.
- **Residual uncertainty, judged compatible with execution:** legacy physical shapes remain volatile (both repositories moved again on 2026-09-03), which is precisely what the contract fixtures and the SA-1.4 drift alarm exist to absorb. Execution bore this out: the physical corrections it surfaced were absorbed by fixtures and the allowlist without touching the capability contract.

### SL-2 … SL-13 — rolling-wave stubs

Deliberately shallow. Each carries only what is needed to prioritize, sequence and reason about dependencies. Detailed acceptance scenarios, edge cases, evidence contracts, estimates and readiness are produced when the Slice is elaborated — inventing them now would manufacture false precision. Content is extracted from Technical Plan v1.4 §9; the "elaborate before READY" column states what is genuinely missing, not a generic placeholder.

| Slice | Governing TDs / contracts | Material risk category | To elaborate before READY |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SL-2 Admission (shadow)** | TD-2 (policy, seeded baseline), TD-8 (case type / definition / facts), admission pipeline, M-SOURCE-EVENTS (interim polling); AC-1, AC-5; ADR-108 | policy authority; duplicate-event idempotency | Fact-key vocabulary and `closure_reason` enums (Technical Plan §11 OPEN, product touchpoint per S1); which S1 acceptance scenarios admission actually proves; correlation-coverage check definition |
| **SL-3 Duplicate & supersession** | TD-7 flows on the SL-0 primitive; AC-6; ADR-109 | lineage correctness; no Case-row mutation | Exact S1 `EC-06` / `AC-15` scenario mapping; what "lineage queryable" must return |
| **SL-4 Supervisor loop (shadow)** | TD-8 root skill, postures, `agent_proposed` Work; **M-SUBJECTS lands here** (TD-14); AC-7, AC-8 | model-mediated behavior; kernel extension | S2 rubric and which S2 acceptance scenarios are in scope; replay reconstruction contract; no-op ratio target |
| **SL-5 Event wake-ups (prod)** `[L:C1]` | TD-13 auth, webhook ingestion, dedup/normalization; AC-1 §6.3/§6.6 | external contract dependency; signature/replay | **Release Scope** — whether "prod" here means production release or the production wake-up path (see §8, Q2); the agreed wake SLA; C1 availability |
| **SL-6 Bindings + authority (advisory)** | TD-4 bindings (`advisor_wa` evidence-only CHECK), TD-3 states + resolver, `/api/legacy/authority` log-only; AC-4; ADR-107 | authority semantics; fail-safe on conflict | What "resolver answers match observed reality" is measured against; C2 advisory availability |
| **SL-7 Work Portfolio v1** | TD-9 views, `/portfolio`, must-surface predicates, TD-15 typed contracts, M-PRESENTATION; AC-9 | first multi-seat user surface → cross-tenant suite gates it | Release Scope (deterministic views vs advisor-facing hosted evidence); `snooze_until` cap (TENTATIVE 14d) |
| **SL-8 Visit evidence v1 (shadow)** | TD-14 visit subjects + subject-scoped facts + external-ref attachment, S3 reconciliation patterns; AC-2, AC-7 | evidence semantics; preserving *unknown* | S3 acceptance mapping; `EvidenceRequest` emission contract |
| **SL-8b Transaction boundary seam** | TD-16 `transaction` shell case type, `recognize_transaction_boundary`, M-TXN-SHELL; AC-6 | boundary misclassification | Release Scope; the §15.18 rationale contract; negative test definition (Legacy-Deal-alone creates nothing) |
| **SL-9 Message effects (assisted)** `[L:C3; **C6 hard gate**]` | TD-6 ledger + `send_prospect_message` (approval-only) + delivery reconciliation, M-EFFECTS; AC-2 | **first prospect-facing external effect**; zero-unapproved-send invariant | **Release Scope** (see §8, Q3); C6 live — a hard gate with no production waiver; C3 availability; delivery-evidence choice (C4 vs §15.7 read, Technical Plan §11 OPEN) |
| **SL-10 Appointment effects (assisted)** `[L:C7]` | TD-6 appointment capabilities + partial-persistence / orphan-Calendar reconciliation → TD-14 visit facts | partial-failure reconciliation; external effect | Release Scope; C7 availability; bounds of the degraded human-as-executor mode |
| **SL-11 Authority transfer (selective live)** `[L:C2 enforcing]` | per-Opportunity `runtime_authority=gu_os`; legacy suppression; takeover suppress/resume; AC-4; ADR-107 | **runtime authority change**; collision risk | Release Scope; C2 enforcing availability; collision replay contract |
| **SL-12 Portfolio v2 (contextual ranking)** | TD-9 v2 model ranking + evidence-grounded explanations + conversational portfolio tools; AC-9 | model-mediated ranking; must-surface suppression | Exact ranking prompt/rubric (Technical Plan §11 OPEN, eval-gated); adversarial fixture set; fallback contract |
| **SL-13 Economics v1** | TD-10 resource events + valuations + WhatsApp metering + reconciliation selftest, M-ECON; AC-10; ADR-110 | cost attribution correctness | Release Scope; rollup identity contract; late-valuation semantics |

No estimates, acceptance scenarios, edge cases, Tasks, files or migration numbers are recorded for these Slices. That is the intended rolling-wave depth, not an omission.

#### Approved DoD evidence carried forward — the elaboration input

Verbatim from approved Technical Plan **v1.4 §9**, which owned this text before the migration. It is reproduced here so nothing approved was lost when the column moved, and so each elaboration starts from the approved evidence requirement rather than from a re-derivation. **This is source material, not an elaborated acceptance contract** — turning it into one is the elaboration work.

| Slice | Approved DoD evidence (Technical Plan v1.4 §9) |
|---|---|
| SL-2 | real inbound leads → dispositions + shadow Cases; duplicate-event idempotency test; policy-version attribution visible |
| SL-3 | S1 EC-06/AC-15 scenarios pass on shadow traffic; lineage queryable; no case-row mutation by relationship ops |
| SL-4 | multi-day shadow Opportunities with coherent posture history; commitment subjects tracked with due/status facts; no-op ratio observable; replay reconstruction test; existing unscoped-fact selftests stay green (compat) |
| SL-5 | signed forwarded event → case wake < agreed SLA; bad/expired signature rejected; duplicate delivery collapses; polling retired |
| SL-6 | binding rows for pilot conversations; resolver answers match observed reality in logs; conflict fail-safe + advisor_wa-ignored tests |
| SL-7 | advisor sees predicate-ranked attention list with WHY/WHAT/WHY-NOW; actions land in canonical mechanisms; snooze never alters business state nor hides must-surface; org-scope authz tests |
| SL-8 | real appointment lifecycle → visit facts with unknown preserved; reschedule does not inflate (1 visit, n schedule facts); property change ⇒ new visit subject; conflict retained |
| SL-8b | concrete-offer scenario → shell Case + association edge + evidence on both timelines with §15.18 rationale; Opportunity unaffected/open; **Legacy-Deal-alone creates nothing (negative test)** |
| SL-9 | approved send → wamid correlated → delivered/failed/unknown exercised; idempotent retry test; zero unapproved sends; zero direct-adapter reads on the effect path (asserted) |
| SL-10 | approved create/reschedule/cancel round-trip visible in legacy stores; injected partial-failure reconciled; visit facts updated with provenance; degraded mode (if invoked) is flag-off + time-bounded + recorded |
| SL-11 | pilot Opportunities answered by exactly one runtime; collision replay green; takeover suppresses Gu while Case continues; all freshness reads on C6 path |
| SL-12 | eval set passes S4-derived rubric; must-surface never suppressed (adversarial fixtures); model-failure fallback to deterministic order |
| SL-13 | send path emits keyed usage; late valuation lands without history rewrite; rollup identity (direct + shared_unallocated) proven |

SL-0's and SL-1's equivalents are not repeated here: both are already expressed as full acceptance contracts in §4 above.

## 5. Execution register (transitional)

Present only while no Development Control Plane exists, and deliberately minimal. It records the Cycle, the confirmed Accountable / DRI, the frozen estimate and the actual metrics **after** execution.

**This section is not authority for live state, and carries no execution stage.** The agent runtime owns just-in-time Tasks and pre-PR implementation and local verification; GitHub owns branch, commits, PR, CI results, merge state, Actions and environment approvals. Do not edit this document to move a Slice through `Proposed → Planned → Implementing → Local Verify → PR / CI`.

| Slice | Execution Cycle | Accountable / DRI | Estimate (frozen at Ready) | Actual to evidence-ready | Human/external wait | Calendar elapsed | Re-planning events | Reopened after Done | Declared → required Release Scope | New verification capability built? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SL-0 | not recorded | not recorded | not available — predates Slice calibration model | not recorded | not recorded | not recorded | not recorded | no | RS-2 → RS-2 | yes — DB-backed cross-tenant suite (`npm run test:rls`) and its CI job |
| SL-1 | Cycle 1 (2026-09-03 → 2026-09-10) | Alejandro Torres Padilla | 3–5 days / Medium *(frozen at READY, 2026-09-03)* | not separately measurable — see note | not separately measurable — see note | **6 h 52 m** to evidence-ready; **6 h 47 m** to the last substantive pre-closure repair | 0 | **1** — post-Done, code-owned; see note | RS-2 → RS-2 | yes — legacy-source verification target (`npm run verify:legacy-reads`) and the Organization-scoped credential bootstrap |

A Slice enters this register when the planning facts it records actually exist, not before. SL-1's Execution Cycle and confirmed Accountable / DRI were filled in by the **Cycle 1 planning decision of 2026-09-03**; its actuals were filled in at Done. Nothing else about SL-1 belongs here: the durable contract in §4 remains the single owner of its scope, acceptance and readiness, and the execution *stage* is never transcribed here (Methodology §19.2). **SL-2…SL-13 have no register rows at all** — none of them is READY.

**Cycle 1 — sequenced plan.** Window **2026-09-03 → 2026-09-10**, approximately one week, opening with this planning decision. The case-B prerequisite is sequenced **first**, inside the Cycle, as named prerequisite / setup work. Under Section 18 proportionality it is deliberately **not** a Slice of its own: issuing two scoped read identities is configuration, not Slice-sized work.

| Order | Work | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Revalidate the current provisioning scope (§4) against live legacy topology — **before either identity is issued**, so each is scoped to what the sources actually require today | prerequisite / setup |
| 2 | Issue the Firestore / GCP read identity with the revalidated scopes, no write authority | prerequisite / setup |
| 3 | Issue the Mongo Atlas read identity, read-only, scoped to the appointment operational record | prerequisite / setup |
| 4 | Make the secret material securely available to the authorized setup path — no value in Git, logs, PRs, fixtures or evidence | prerequisite / setup |
| 5 | **SL-1 Gateway reads v1 (bootstrap)** | Slice |

**How provisioning time is accounted.** Items 1–4 are **pre-execution** work and sit outside SL-1's frozen 3–5 day agent-assisted engineering estimate. Time a human or external party blocks on them is recorded separately as **human / external wait** (Methodology §17.1, metric 3). It does **not** count toward SL-1's **calendar elapsed**, which §17.1 defines as running *from execution start* to evidence-ready / Done — and SL-1's execution starts only once it is Executable, which cannot happen before these items are complete. Folding prerequisite time into either the engineering figure or the calendar figure would corrupt the first calibration data point this initiative produces.

**If the prerequisite slips.** Should provisioning take long enough to make the Cycle target unrealistic, the Cycle is **re-planned explicitly** — the estimate is not quietly enlarged and the Cycle is not quietly extended. The re-planning event and its cause are recorded in this register.

**Prerequisite satisfied — 2026-09-04.** All four sequenced items are complete, so SL-1's case-B dependency is met and the Slice is Executable (Planned, confirmed Accountable, prerequisite satisfied, capacity available — nothing else is in flight). Cycle 1 still opens 2026-09-03 with the planning decision; the prerequisite closed the following day.

| Item | Delivered |
|---|---|
| 1 — revalidate scope | Done before issuance; two corrections applied above |
| 2 — Firestore / GCP identity | `gu-os-sl1-reader` service accounts with `roles/datastore.viewer`, read-only, in both the stage (`unggafb`) and production (`ungga-full`) projects. Project-level read blast radius as TD-5 accepts; containment stays with the Gu OS collection allowlist and the per-read Organization binding check |
| 3 — Mongo Atlas identity | `gu-os-sl1-reader`, read-only, scoped to one cluster |
| 4 — secret material available | Present to the authorized setup path. For this bootstrap the key files stay in the working tree, git-ignored, and are referenced **by file path**, so no key material sits inside an environment value; the Atlas URI lives in the git-ignored local environment file. This is the arrangement chosen for *this* material, not a general secrets policy. No secret value appears in Git, logs, PRs, fixtures or evidence |

**Human-accepted temporary least-privilege deviation (Mongo).** The delivered identity grants database-level `read` on two databases (`bot`, `gu2`) rather than a collection-level `find` on `appointments` alone. Both databases carry collections SL-1 never queries — `bot` also holds the conversation store this Slice deliberately reads from Firestore instead, and `gu2` holds reminder, template-retry, ads and bug-informer collections outside the capability surface.

This is **accepted explicitly by the human accountable for SL-1**, on 2026-09-04, as a temporary bootstrap deviation. It is **not a defect, and not an autonomous engineering decision** — the analysis was surfaced with a recommendation, and the acceptance is the human's. The accepted rationale: the grant is read-only; it reaches a single cluster; SL-1 remains shadow-only; Gu OS still exposes only the bounded capability surface plus its code allowlist; no generic CRUD tool is introduced; and the direct bootstrap adapters are temporary, with **C6 remaining the hard gate before SL-9 and any prospect-facing effect**.

**Human revalidation under the corrected physical fact — 2026-09-04.** The original acceptance was written believing the appointment source was `bot.appointments`. It is `gu2.appointments`, confirmed with the Traditional Gu team. The human accountable for SL-1 **revalidated the deviation explicitly against the corrected fact**, and the revalidation is what governs:

- the appointment source SL-1 requires is **`gu2.appointments`**;
- the current read-only identity **may continue to cover `bot` and `gu2`** for this bootstrap;
- **no Mongo identity reprovisioning is required** merely because the source is `gu2` — the existing identity already reaches it;
- this **remains a temporary bootstrap deviation**;
- the **C6 retirement boundary is unchanged**.

Stated precisely, so the two things are not conflated: **access to `gu2.appointments` is what SL-1 requires** — a grant confined to `bot` would not reach the appointment source at all. **The deviation is the broader database-level `read` across `bot` and `gu2`**, rather than the least-privilege minimum, and that remains the human-accepted temporary condition. If it is ever narrowed *before* C6 — which the revalidation does not require — the minimum required Mongo grant is a collection-level `find` on **`gu2.appointments`**.

**Retirement condition:** revisit and retire the direct credential path **no later than the C6 transition, before assisted effects**. That is the same boundary TD-5 already sets for the bootstrap adapters themselves, so the credential and the adapter path retire together rather than the credential outliving what justified it.

**Production boundary, stated precisely.** Production **IAM/credential provisioning did occur**: a `gu-os-sl1-reader` service account now exists in the `ungga-full` production project with `roles/datastore.viewer`. That is a real change to production identity configuration and should not be described as "production untouched". What did **not** occur: **no Gu OS production runtime or data read**, **no production deployment**, and **no business or prospect-facing effect**.

**The production key, before and after the hosted evidence run.** When the prerequisite closed on 2026-09-04 the key was **issued and valid but deliberately unwired** — nothing in the setup path referenced it — so that the window in which a project-wide production Firestore reader is actually exercised stayed as short as TD-5's time-boxed framing intends. Wiring it was a step inside the Slice, not a new prerequisite.

It was **subsequently exercised, once and only for the authorized SA-1.2 / SA-1.3 evidence path**, on the explicit authorization of the human Accountable. That path is read-only: Traditional Gu production was read, nothing was written to any legacy store, and there was **no Gu OS production deployment and no Gu OS production runtime** — the gateway code executed in the operator's verifier process against Gu OS *staging* state. The run is recorded in [`sl1-hosted-evidence.md`](sl1-hosted-evidence.md).

**Completion — the Mongo side, 2026-09-04.** The paragraph above is written entirely in Firestore terms, because Firestore has two projects and the stage/production distinction is meaningful there. Mongo has **one** Atlas cluster and no stage equivalent, so every Mongo read SL-1 performs is, by construction, a read of that single production cluster. The shape-discovery reads that produced SL-1's recorded source contracts were such reads: read-only `find` and `estimatedDocumentCount`, sampling field names and counts, with no value retained, nothing written and no prospect-facing effect.

**Those reads were within approved SL-1 execution authority**, not an expansion of it. Methodology §14.2 separates behavior/authority mode from Release Scope — `shadow` means no external effects, and RS-3 is defined by what a **Gu OS** production *release* adds (production authorization, schema preflight, controlled deploy, post-release verification, canary/rollback), none of which describes reading a source system Gu OS does not own. Technical Plan §8 goes further and *requires* "a staging pass with pilot credentials", which can only mean the pilot's real records. The case-B prerequisite provisioned this identity for exactly this purpose, and SL-1's Definition of Done requires a contract fixture for `appointment_get`, which cannot be recorded without reading the appointment source. Reading it was required work.

**Recorded as a narrow documentation ambiguity, not a breach.** What the governing sources do not state is how the word "production" applies to a **legacy source system** Gu OS reads but does not own or deploy to. Every definition in the Methodology and the release-path playbook is written for Gu OS's own deployment target. That gap is why this paragraph was originally silent on Mongo. It is worth a later methodology refinement — a sentence distinguishing *Gu OS production release* from *reading an external system's production data* — and is logged here rather than resolved unilaterally. Detail in [`sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md`](sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md) §5.

**SL-1 actuals — what the evidence supports, and what it does not.**

**Where evidence-ready falls, and why not earlier.** Completing the RS-2 hosted run (20:12:24 −06:00, `ranAt` in its artifact) is *not* the boundary. This plan said so itself at v1.5 — hosted evidence complete, still not Done, because the deterministic CI layer RS-1 requires was outstanding — and the frozen estimate was written to cover "PR/CI iterations through evidence". So the anchor is the first reviewed implementation head that carried every substantive repair **and** satisfied the complete required evidence set.

The anchors are defensible timestamps, not recollection:

| Boundary | Timestamp (−06:00) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Execution start | 2026-09-04 **14:41:29** | `git reflog` — branch created from `main` |
| Last substantive pre-closure repair | 2026-09-04 **21:28:07** | committer date of the reviewed head `7634eca…`, which is what the amend that folded in the accepted evidence-metadata policy actually produced |
| **Evidence-ready** | 2026-09-04 **21:33:03** | successful deterministic CI completion for that exact head |

Calendar elapsed follows directly: **6 h 52 m** from execution start to evidence-ready, and **6 h 47 m** to the last substantive repair before closure.

**Metrics 2 and 3 are deliberately not given as numbers.** Splitting that window into agent-assisted engineering versus human/external wait would require timestamps that do not exist: commit times record when work *landed*, not when it *resumed* after a human reply, and four human decision boundaries fall inside the window — the authorization to read production and select a lead, the encryption-key provisioning stop, the evidence-metadata policy decision, and the PR review. Each is visible as a gap between commits, but no gap separates thinking from waiting. Inventing a split would corrupt the first data point in a calibration series whose whole purpose is honesty about estimate bias.

What can be stated rigorously is the bound and nothing beyond it: **agent-assisted engineering elapsed ≤ total calendar elapsed to evidence-ready (6 h 52 m)**. On that basis the frozen **3–5 day** estimate was **materially conservative — biased high**. The size of that bias is deliberately left unquantified: metric 2 is not separately measured, and this methodology establishes no hours-per-"day" conversion for an estimate expressed in days, so any ratio would be arithmetic on two undefined quantities. This is `n = 1`: per §17.1 it begins calibrating bias, and must not be read as a productivity multiplier.

**Pre-execution provisioning is excluded, as planned.** Issuing the two read identities and making their material available happened before the branch existed and is recorded as prerequisite work in this section, not as SL-1 engineering or SL-1 calendar time. The staging encryption-key provisioning was a human setup action inside the execution window; it is one of the four boundaries above and is likewise not engineering time.

**Metric 5 — re-planning events: 0.** The Cycle was never re-planned, the estimate was never re-opened, and no Slice scope changed. Three physical-source and design corrections were surfaced during execution (the Mongo database, the appointment key topology, the production-boundary record); under §15 these are documentation-owned defects repaired in the owning artifact, not re-planning.

**Metric 6 — reopen after Done: 1.** Two distinct events, and the distinction is exactly what this metric exists to keep clean.

*Before Done*, PR review found three implementation defects — a product path that accepted unproven credentials, adapter caches that shadowed credential rotation, and appointment containment proven from only the first record. All **code-owned** under §15, repaired with regression coverage. Not a reopen: the Slice had not closed.

*After Done*, final review found two more, and SL-1 was **reopened**. Both are **code-owned** (§15) and neither touches scope, contract, acceptance meaning or Release Scope:

- **`appointment_get` could silently drop a same-store record.** Cross-store pairing on property + date + hour assigned `pair.firestore = view`, so two Firestore records sharing that key overwrote one another — and the same for Mongo. The evidence established that the two stores share no per-appointment identifier; it never established that the key is unique *within* a store, and no source invariant enforces it. Repaired fail-closed: a same-store duplicate key now refuses as `pairing_ambiguous` rather than inventing a match.
- **The bounded Mongo read could return a truncated set as complete.** `.limit(200)` with no overflow signal, and nothing bounds appointments per deal. Both readers now fetch one past the bound and the capability refuses as `result_too_large`; the Firestore side, which was unbounded, is bounded the same way.

Deterministic coverage was added for both, including that no record from a consulted store disappears in the success case and that a result exactly at the bound is returned in full. The degraded mode where no Mongo credential is bound is unchanged and still covered: the capability answers from Firestore and records `storesConsulted.mongo = false`, so a single-store answer is never presented as complete across both. **RS-2 is preserved** — the evidence requirement itself did not change — and the frozen estimate is untouched. Not a re-planning event: nothing about scope or contract moved.

**Metric 7 — Release Scope: RS-2 declared, RS-2 required.** No mid-flight change.

**Metric 8 — new verification capability: yes, two.** A hosted verification target for a legacy source system, which the Supabase-only harness could not reach, and the Organization-scoped credential bootstrap that proves a credential before it is trusted. Both were anticipated by the Definition of Done rather than discovered late, following SL-0's `test:rls` precedent.

Metrics are recorded for the first 3–5 real Slices to calibrate estimate bias and variance (Methodology §17.1); they do not establish a productivity multiplier. SL-0 predates the model, so R1's calibration series begins at SL-1.

## 6. Done records

### SL-0 — Done 2026-09-01 (recorded with Technical Plan v1.4)

- **Release Scope achieved:** RS-2 (hosted).
- **Environment reached:** deterministic local + CI, then the **`Gu-OS-Stage`** hosted environment. **Production was not reached.**
- **Evidence:** authoritative record in [`technical-plan.md`](technical-plan.md) §9, "Execution status — SL-0". In summary: the frozen 87-migration chain applies cleanly and the cross-tenant suite passes **36 checks** against a real PostgreSQL 16 (pgvector); a mutation check confirms the restrictive UPDATE guard is load-bearing; the same chain applied in full through `00084` in `Gu-OS-Stage`, where every hosted security invariant matched the deterministic assertions.
- **Verified:** Alebrixe Organization resolvable via the normalized bare owner UID, with the raw `users/<uid>` form retained as provenance only and not resolving as a routing key; exactly one Organization and one binding after apply *and* after an idempotent rerun; explicit seat mapping (Mariana `owner`, Alejandro `advisor`), neither mutated by the rerun; JSONB discovery source byte-identical before and after bootstrap; a falsifiable negative control proving that neither legacy discovery state nor `is_ungga_admin` confers membership; hosted cross-tenant read and write verified with real authenticated user JWTs rather than the privileged service credential.
- **Not exercised:** **production** — no migration applied, no data written, no connection made. Production rollout is the separate **Gate B**, and a read-only production schema-state preflight remains mandatory before `00080`–`00084` are applied there. Also not exercised: any gateway read of live legacy data (that is SL-1), and any prospect-facing effect (shadow stage, per Technical Plan §5).

### SL-1 — Done 2026-09-05, reopened and re-closed 2026-09-05

- **Release Scope achieved:** **RS-2 (hosted)** — as declared at READY, unchanged.
- **Environment reached:** deterministic local + CI, then **Gu OS `Gu-OS-Stage`** for hosted state, reading **Traditional Gu production** (`ungga-full`) read-only through the SL-1 read identity. **Gu OS production was not reached**: no deployment, no migration, no read. There is no deployed Gu OS application runtime in staging, so the gateway code executed in the operator's verification process against staging state.
- **Evidence:** authoritative record in [`sl1-hosted-evidence.md`](sl1-hosted-evidence.md), with machine-readable artifacts under [`evidence/`](evidence/). Credential scopes and their retirement condition in [`sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md`](sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md).

**Slice Acceptance Contract — all seven assertions evidenced.**

| ID | Evidenced by |
|---|---|
| SA-1.1 | `test:legacy-gateway` — four capabilities normalized against recorded contract fixtures, each result carrying provenance |
| SA-1.2 | hosted run of 2026-09-05: a real Alebrixe lead read with provenance **and** freshness (`edited_time`, age recorded), through the Organization-scoped credential path |
| SA-1.3 | deterministic thread-aware coverage plus the same hosted run — 50 items, every item naming its thread and carrying a delivery status |
| SA-1.4 | injected fixture mismatch fires the drift alarm and refuses; an additive field does not |
| SA-1.5 | credential scopes documented, including the accepted whole-database Firestore read and its time-boxed shadow-only bound |
| SA-1.6 | four refusal paths, each asserting the reader recorded **zero reads**; containment carried the hosted run, where `bindingState` was `unbound` |
| SA-1.7 | closed four-capability surface, no generic CRUD parameter, no effect-shaped method, no reachable prospect-facing effect |

**Definition of Done — satisfied.** The four capabilities exist behind the bounded tool surface with fixtures and selftests wired into `test:selftests`; Organization-scoped secret handling was built inside the Slice and exercised end to end, with the `pending_test → active` lifecycle observed as a transition in hosted staging; the hosted verification capability for a legacy read target was built inside the Slice; hosted evidence is recorded naming the environment reached; the drift alarm is demonstrated firing; credential scopes are documented; and this record states what was intentionally not exercised.

**Reopened once, after Done.** Final review found two code-owned defects in
`appointment_get`, both of which would have made an already-recorded claim
false rather than merely incomplete: a same-store duplicate pairing key silently
discarded a record, and the bounded Mongo read could return a truncated set as
complete. Both are repaired fail-closed — `pairing_ambiguous` and
`result_too_large` — with deterministic coverage, and the Firestore side is now
bounded the same way. The Slice Acceptance Contract, Definition of Done and
Release Scope are unchanged; what changed is that the capability now returns
every record from every store it actually consults, up to the bounded limit, or
refuses. The degraded mode is untouched: with no Mongo credential bound it still
answers and marks `storesConsulted.mongo = false`. Recorded as metric 6 = 1 in §5.

**Verified beyond the minimum, because review demanded it.** Product reads resolve **only** `active` credentials, with the connection-check exception named rather than flagged; credential rotation retires the cached driver client through a non-secret fingerprint, closing the Mongo pool; and every appointment in a result set must share one resolvable owner contained to the calling Organization before any of it is returned.

**Not exercised — deliberately, and not to be read as proven:**

- **`appointment_get` and `property_get_details` against real hosted data.** The approved DoD does not require it and the Slice contract disclaims it; both remain fixture-verified. The Mongo *credential* was proven; the Mongo *capability* was not.
- **Any prospect-facing effect.** Shadow stage: the surface is read-only and has no write path.
- **Gu OS production.** Gate B is unchanged, and the read-only production schema-state preflight before `00080`–`00084` remains mandatory.
- **Advisor threads and delivery-status writeback.** Not present on any of the 80 Alebrixe leads examined. SL-6 should not assume advisor threads are populated for this pilot; SL-9 should verify the §15.7 writeback on recent traffic before depending on it.

**Deterministic CI evidence.** RS-1's CI layer is required for RS-2 and was green on the reviewed head, and must be green again for the head that lands the reopen repair. **GitHub owns that verdict, not this document** (Methodology §19.1): the closure commit recording this Done state necessarily changes the head, CI runs again there, and **a red result on the landing commit reopens this record.** Stating it that way keeps the record falsifiable rather than self-certifying.

**Retirement condition carried forward.** The direct bootstrap adapters and both read credentials retire together **no later than the C6 transition, before assisted effects** — the boundary TD-5 sets, unchanged by anything in this Slice.

No Done records exist for SL-2…SL-13.

## 7. Change log

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 2026-09-03 | Initial Slice Plan. Slice contracts extracted from approved Technical Plan v1.4 §9 under Methodology v0.3.1: SL-0 as a completed historical Slice referencing its existing closure evidence, SL-1 as a full draft contract, SL-2…SL-13 as rolling-wave stubs. No R1 scope, behavior, acceptance meaning, architecture decision, cross-repo contract, rollout model or sequencing changed. Status: Draft, pending human review. |
| v1.0 | 2026-09-03 | **Approved as the governing R1 Slice Plan** after human review of the first initiative migrated to the Slice model. Four review corrections applied, all narrowing claims rather than changing scope: (1) the SL-1 credential dependency no longer asserts Definition-of-Ready **case C** — Technical Plan §11 says only "obtainable" and establishes no class, so classification is deferred to the dedicated SL-1 readiness pass, and SL-1 is NOT READY for the elaboration reason alone; (2) SL-1's inspectable outcome now separates the four fixture-verified capabilities from the hosted evidence the approved v1.4 DoD actually requires, and explicitly disclaims any real appointment or property read; (3) SL-0's readiness cell reads `N/A — historical Done` so that **Done** stays a completion concept and never becomes a third readiness value; (4) SL-1's pre-READY row was removed from the transitional execution register — its initial estimate stays in the durable contract and is frozen only at READY. **Approval means** the artifact structure is approved and the recorded contracts and stubs are the governing planning truth. **It does not mean** SL-1 is READY, PLANNED or EXECUTABLE, nor that implementation may begin. |
| v1.1 | 2026-09-03 | **SL-1 readiness/elaboration pass — SL-1 becomes READY.** First-hand legacy-source revalidation performed with the audit's own §23.1 method against both Traditional Gu repositories as of 2026-09-03 (13 commits / 47 files and 32 commits / 61 files of drift since the 2026-08-31 audit revalidation; both pins still ancestors). **No semantic contract change** was found for any of the four capabilities: the lead and conversation sources are untouched, appointments are untouched, and the property change is confined to the public SEO sitemap path while reaffirming Firestore as the authoritative record. Recorded one new fixture-relevant shape: a property's `user_owner` appears both as a `DocumentReference` and as a text path. Credential dependency **classified case B** with evidence — the credentials do not exist today, but issuance is administered by this team without a third party — resolving Q4. Definition of Done gains the hosted verification capability for a legacy read target, which does not exist in the Supabase-only harness and is therefore built inside the Slice, following the SL-0 `test:rls` precedent. Estimate revised **2–3 → 3–5 days**, confidence Medium, and **frozen at READY**: fixture risk fell because no semantic drift was found, while two net-new capabilities replaced it. RS-2 reconfirmed. Reconciled against **Methodology v0.3.2** after that release corrected the circular case-B rule this very pass exposed. The reconciliation moved the credential boundary on evidence: `organization_tool_secrets` has **zero code references** — table only, no query module, no runtime retrieval, and the `account-tool-secrets.ts` precedent is user-scoped — so seeding its rows cannot be a pre-execution prerequisite without depending on code SL-1 itself builds. The prerequisite now stops at the two external read identities and their secret material being available to the authorized setup path; all Organization-scoped secret handling is in-Slice work. Credential scope was minimized against least privilege: Firestore for the lead, its `wsp_messeges` threads, `users`/`users_sellers`, `properties` and the appointment replica; Mongo **only** for the appointment record, because audit §11.3 proves appointment persistence is not atomic across stores. Mongo `property_data`, `chats`/`messagesv2`, the waProbe arrays, the lead runtime context and BigQuery were all excluded with reasons. Physical names are labelled current provisioning scope, revalidate before issuance — not semantic architecture. **READY means eligible for Cycle planning, not authorized to execute.** No DRI, Execution Cycle, planning status or JIT Task was created. |
| v1.2 | 2026-09-03 | **First Execution Cycle planning decision.** SL-1 confirmed into **Cycle 1** (**2026-09-03 → 2026-09-10**, ~1 week) with **Alejandro Torres Padilla** as confirmed human Accountable / DRI — the two facts that together constitute `Planned`. Only SL-1 was eligible: it is the sole READY Slice, SL-0 is historical and SL-2…SL-13 are NOT READY stubs. Per Methodology §12.1 the case-B prerequisite is **explicitly sequenced first**, inside the Cycle, as named prerequisite / setup work; under §18 proportionality it is deliberately not a Slice of its own. Provisioning is **pre-execution** work: blocking time on it is recorded as **human / external wait**, and it counts toward neither SL-1's frozen 3–5 day agent-assisted engineering estimate nor its **calendar elapsed**, which §17.1 measures from execution start — a point SL-1 cannot reach until the prerequisite is complete. If provisioning slips far enough to make the Cycle target unrealistic, the Cycle is re-planned **explicitly** rather than the estimate or the Cycle being quietly extended. **SL-1 is Planned but not Executable**: the two external read identities do not exist yet. No JIT Tasks, no implementation, no credentials created. Following §19.2, the register records the Cycle and DRI but never the execution stage. |
| v1.7 | 2026-09-05 | **SL-1 reopened after Done and re-closed; both defects code-owned.** Final PR review raised two questions about `appointment_get`, and neither was disproved by a source invariant, so both were repaired. (1) **Same-store records could be silently dropped.** Cross-store pairing on property + date + hour overwrote an earlier record when two records from the *same* store shared that key. The recorded evidence establishes that the two stores share no per-appointment identifier; it never establishes that the key is unique within a store, and nothing in Firestore, Mongo or the audit enforces it — audit §11.3's retry-tolerant partial persistence is a plausible way to produce two. Now refuses as `pairing_ambiguous` rather than inventing a one-to-one match. (2) **The bounded Mongo read could truncate silently.** `.limit(200)` returned a partial set as complete, and no contract bounds appointments per deal; both readers now fetch one past the bound and the capability refuses as `result_too_large`, with the previously unbounded Firestore read bounded the same way. Deterministic coverage added for same-store duplicates on both sides, overflow on both sides, a result exactly at the bound returned in full, and the invariant that no record disappears. **Metric 6 moves 0 → 1**, code-owned under §15. The frozen estimate is untouched, RS-2 is preserved, and this is **not** a re-planning event: no scope, contract or acceptance meaning changed. Stated precisely, the guarantee this repair establishes is: **`appointment_get` returns every record from every store it actually consults, up to the bounded limit, or it refuses.** Three things hold — no consulted-store record is silently dropped by pairing; no consulted-store result is silently truncated past the bound; and an unconsulted Mongo store is explicitly represented as incomplete via `storesConsulted.mongo = false`, which is pre-existing behaviour this repair preserves rather than a gap it closes. |
| v1.6 | 2026-09-05 | **SL-1 Done.** The full Slice Acceptance Contract (SA-1.1 … SA-1.7), the Definition of Done and RS-2 hosted evidence are satisfied, and the deterministic CI layer RS-1 requires was green on the reviewed implementation head. Adds the §6 Done record — environment reached, Release Scope achieved, assertions evidenced, and what was deliberately not exercised — and completes the §5 execution register, which opens R1's calibration series. **Evidence-ready is anchored at successful CI on the reviewed head, not at completion of the hosted run**: v1.5 recorded hosted evidence as complete and the Slice as still not Done for exactly that reason, and the frozen estimate covers PR/CI iterations through evidence. Calendar elapsed from defensible timestamps: **6 h 52 m** execution start to evidence-ready, **6 h 47 m** to the last substantive pre-closure repair. The register **declines to split** that window into engineering versus wait, because no timestamp separates the two and a fabricated split would corrupt the first calibration point; it states only the defensible bound — engineering elapsed cannot exceed calendar elapsed — from which the frozen **3–5 day** estimate reads as **materially conservative, biased high**, with the size of that bias deliberately left unquantified. Pre-execution provisioning stays excluded, as planned. Re-planning events: 0. Reopen after Done: 0, with review-driven repair before Done recorded separately as code-owned under §15. Release Scope RS-2 declared and RS-2 required. Two new verification capabilities built inside the Slice. The Done record is deliberately falsifiable: CI truth for the landing commit is owned by GitHub, and a red result there reopens it. No Slice contract, acceptance assertion, Release Scope, estimate or readiness value was changed by this closure. |
| v1.5 | 2026-09-05 | **SL-1 RS-2 hosted evidence complete; still not Done.** The Organization-scoped credential path was completed and exercised end to end: both read identities stored in Gu OS staging against the Alebrixe Organization, the `pending_test -> active` lifecycle **observed as a transition** rather than inferred, and SA-1.2 / SA-1.3 re-run with readers resolved **through `organization_tool_secrets`** — 13/13 required checks. The 2026-09-04 run is retained and classified **preliminary**: it read through the declared legacy target and therefore evidenced the adapters, not credential resolution. The bounded `relationship_ops` activation was restored to its observed pre-run state (absent), and that restoration is now built into the verifier rather than remembered. **Done still requires deterministic CI evidence** (Methodology §14.2: RS-2 = RS-1 + hosted, and RS-1 includes the required CI evidence), after which the §6 Done record and the §5 register actuals close the Slice. No Slice contract, acceptance assertion, Release Scope, estimate or readiness value changed. |
| v1.4 | 2026-09-04 | **Physical-source correction, human revalidation and boundary completion during SL-1 execution.** None of it changes approved scope, a Slice contract, an acceptance assertion, Release Scope, an estimate or a readiness value. (1) **The Mongo appointment source is `gu2.appointments`.** The pre-issuance scope placed it in `bot`, which has no such collection — an incorrect physical-source assumption, not a contract the implementation departed from. Observed during execution and then **confirmed directly with the Traditional Gu team**, so it is now legacy-owner-confirmed information. (2) **The human accountable revalidated the temporary Mongo deviation against the corrected fact**: the required source is `gu2.appointments`, the existing read-only identity may continue to cover `bot` and `gu2` for this bootstrap, **no reprovisioning is required**, the deviation stays temporary and the **C6 retirement boundary is unchanged**. Stated precisely: access to `gu2.appointments` is what SL-1 requires, while the deviation itself remains the broader database-level `read` across `bot` and `gu2`; narrowed before C6, the minimum would be a collection-level `find` on `gu2.appointments`. (3) **The production-boundary record is completed on the Mongo side.** One Atlas cluster and no stage equivalent means every SL-1 Mongo read is a production-cluster read; those reads were **within approved execution authority** (Methodology §14.2 separates shadow behavior from RS-3 Gu OS release; Technical Plan §8 requires a staging pass with pilot credentials; the DoD requires an `appointment_get` contract fixture). Logged alongside it: a narrow **documentation ambiguity** — the governing sources define "production" for Gu OS's own deployment target and never say how the term applies to a legacy source system Gu OS reads but does not own. Firestore production remained unwired until the authorized hosted evidence run. Adds [`sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md`](sl1-legacy-read-credentials.md) (SA-1.5) and [`sl1-hosted-evidence.md`](sl1-hosted-evidence.md) (SA-1.2/SA-1.3). |
| v1.3 | 2026-09-04 | **Cycle 1 case-B prerequisite completed; SL-1 becomes Executable.** Cycle 1 still opens 2026-09-03 with the planning decision; the prerequisite closed 2026-09-04. Scope revalidated before issuance, as sequenced item 1 required: both legacy repositories had moved again, but the drift was physical only. Two corrections resulted — Firestore appointments live under `deals/{deal_id}/appointments` rather than in a root collection, and `users_sellers` is dropped because SL-1 resolves Organization binding through Gu OS `external_identity_bindings`. Confirmed with the legacy owner that `bot` is `MONGO_DB_NAME`, and from source that `property_data` sits in a different database the delivered identity cannot reach, so that exclusion holds at the credential perimeter. Dedicated read-only identities issued on both sides. **Production boundary, precisely:** production IAM/credential provisioning DID occur — a `roles/datastore.viewer` service account now exists in the `ungga-full` project — while no Gu OS production runtime or data read, no production deployment and no business or prospect-facing effect occurred; the production key is issued and valid but **not yet wired or used**, and stays so until the hosted evidence run. Recorded a **human-accepted temporary least-privilege deviation** on the Mongo grant (database-level on `bot`/`gu2` rather than collection-level on `appointments`): accepted explicitly by the human accountable, not a defect and not an autonomous engineering decision, on the stated rationale that it is read-only, single-cluster, shadow-only, behind the bounded capability surface and code allowlist, with no generic CRUD; **to be revisited and retired no later than the C6 transition, before assisted effects**. `.gitignore` covers the key and password material, scoped as a decision about this material rather than a general secrets policy. No implementation, no JIT Tasks. |

## 8. Open questions surfaced by this migration

Recorded rather than silently resolved, per Methodology §15 and the migration instruction. **None of these is a change to approved R1 content** — each is an ambiguity the Slice format made visible.

| # | Question | Why it matters | Proposed disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | **Acceptance-identifier namespace collision.** `AC-1…AC-10` are *architecture contracts* (Architecture Analysis §6–§15), while S1 and S2 use zero-padded `AC-01…AC-nn` for *Spec acceptance scenarios*. So `AC-7` and `AC-07` are different things in different documents, and S3 references `AC-2 / AC-7 / AC-8` meaning the architecture contracts. | Slice traceability depends on identifiers being unambiguous. A future Slice contract citing "AC-7" is genuinely ambiguous. | Human decision. This plan disambiguates in prose everywhere (writing "architecture contract AC-1" or "S2 AC-20"). A durable fix would be a naming convention, which is a documentation-governance decision outside this migration. |
| Q2 | **SL-5's Release Scope is not derivable.** Its title says "(prod)" and its DoD retires polling, but Technical Plan §5 places SL-5 inside the **shadow** stage (SL-0…SL-8b, no prospect-facing effects). "Prod" appears to mean the production *wake-up path* rather than a production *release*. | RS-2 versus RS-3 changes the Done boundary and the authority required. | Left as `TBD at elaboration`. Needs confirmation from the Technical Plan owner; not resolvable without redesigning meaning. |
| Q3 | **Where the RS-3 boundary falls for the assisted stage.** SL-9 and SL-10 produce real external effects visible in legacy stores (a `wamid`-correlated prospect message; an appointment round-trip). Whether that constitutes RS-3 "production" under Methodology §14.2, or RS-2 hosted evidence in a pilot-scoped environment, is not stated by any current source. | This determines whether the playbook's production release path (§7 — explicit authorization, read-only preflight, canary, rollback) is engaged for those Slices. | Left as `TBD at elaboration`. This is a release-authority question for a human, and deliberately not decided here. |
| Q4 | ~~SL-1's read credentials are an unresolved readiness dependency of unknown class.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-09-03 — case B**, under Methodology v0.3.2. | — | The readiness pass established first-hand that the identities do not exist today (no environment variable, no environment secret, no runbook) but that issuance is administered by this team, with direct administrative access to both providers and no third party required. Under v0.3.2 the prerequisite is stated as a **concrete contract** in SL-1's dependency list — what must exist, at what scope, with what prohibitions — satisfiable without executing SL-1. Case B permits READY and withholds EXECUTABLE. |

Nothing in this section blocks review of the structure itself; Q2 and Q3 block only the Release Scope fields they name.
