/**
 * Model-facing surface for the four Traditional Gu read capabilities
 * (R1 SL-1 / TD-5).
 *
 * The gateway itself lives in `apps/web/src/lib/legacy-gateway/` because it
 * reaches external source systems. This module is only the seam: it defines the
 * tool shapes, resolves which Organization a tool call is authorized against,
 * and turns a typed refusal into a structured tool result instead of a thrown
 * turn failure.
 *
 * Two decisions worth stating, because both are authority-adjacent:
 *
 *   * **The Organization is resolved, never supplied by the model.** A model
 *     argument naming an Organization would be a caller-supplied tenant claim,
 *     which the audit (16) and Technical Plan 6 both say must not be trusted.
 *     It is derived from the actor's active memberships, and when that is
 *     ambiguous the call fails closed rather than picking one.
 *   * **A refusal is a result, not an exception.** The model needs to know it
 *     may not read something, and needs to not retry. A structured
 *     `status: "refused"` with a reason does that; a thrown error would just
 *     end the turn.
 *
 * Every call is audited: each tool writes and closes its own `tool_calls` row,
 * as the graph expects of every tool not listed in tool-audit-ownership.ts — a
 * low-risk read auto-executes, and on that path the graph writes none (Cycle 3
 * order 4, Slice Plan v1.31 §6).
