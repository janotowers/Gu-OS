/**
 * Organizations, memberships and the single write-authorization helper

 *
 * Authorization rules this module exists to enforce:
 *   * every Organization-owned write is server-authorized — user JWTs have no
 *     direct write path to Organization business tables in R1 (the database
 *     enforces the same thing, this is the application half);
 *   * identity is not authorization: `authorizeOrgAction` always re-checks
 *     `status = "active"` at action time, and callers persist the returned
 *     actor + role on consequential decisions;
 *   * fail closed: a missing, inactive or unreadable membership never widens
 *     authority.

 *   * `legacyOrganizationKey` — the NORMALIZED identity (the bare owner UID).
 *     This is the external routing key and the only thing resolution matches on.
 *   * `rawLegacySource` — the raw representation it was normalized from (e.g.
 *     `users/<uid>`), recorded as provenance in the same statement. It explains
 *     where the key came from; nothing ever routes on it.
 *
 * Inbound WhatsApp routing is a different external identity and binds as
 * `gu_whatsapp_number` — never through this function.
 *
 * Delegates to the SQL function rather than doing select-then-insert here:
 * supabase-js has no transaction API, so only the database can create the
 * Organization, its binding and that provenance atomically. A crash leaves
 * either nothing or a complete record. Re-runs and concurrent runs converge.
 *
 * Creates NO membership. The profile a legacy identity was discovered on does
 * not become a member as a side effect — membership is supplied explicitly,
 * with an explicit role, via `ensureOrganizationMembership`.
 *
 * Service-role only — the function's EXECUTE privilege is restricted.
