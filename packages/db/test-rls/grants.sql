-- Supabase grants table privileges to anon/authenticated/service_role out of
-- the box. Without them every query in this suite would be refused for lack of
-- a GRANT rather than by row-level security, and every negative assertion would
-- pass for the wrong reason. These grants exist so that a denial in the suite
-- means RLS actually denied it.
--
-- Deliberately NO blanket `grant execute on all functions`: that would silently
-- undo the explicit EXECUTE revokes on bootstrap_organization (00082),
-- resolve_or_create_contact_for_legacy_lead (forward SL-15) and
-- is_active_org_member (00080), which this suite asserts.
