/**
 * Bounded operational read capabilities over Traditional Gu (R1 SL-1 / TD-5,
 * architecture contract AC-1).
 *
 * These types are the **durable interface**. The adapter behind each capability
 * is a replaceable bootstrap detail (direct Firestore/Mongo reads today,
 * bounded legacy-side read APIs at cross-repo contract C6); the capability
 * contract is what callers depend on and what fixtures pin.
 *
 * Three rules the shapes here exist to enforce:
 *   * **No generic CRUD, ever.** The vocabulary is closed: four semantic
 *     capabilities, each with its own typed request and result. There is no
 *     "read collection X" shape to widen into one.
 *   * **Provenance on every result** - where it came from, which store, when it
 *     was read, and through which adapter. A normalized value without
 *     provenance is not a gateway result.
 *   * **External identifiers stay opaque.** `legacy_lead_id` is a composite
 *     operational-context key (audit 5.1); it is carried whole and never parsed
 *     into phone-number components.
